## Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Diagnostic Vault

### Core Diagnostic Criteria

* PMDD is officially recognized in DSM-5 and ICD-11.
* Distinct from PMS: PMDD is more intense, disabling, and cyclical.
* Not due to hormone *imbalance*, but heightened sensitivity to normal hormonal shifts.
* Symptoms occur during luteal phase and resolve near menstruation.
* Diagnosis typically requires 2+ months of symptom tracking.
* Historically dismissed; entrenched in cultural silence and stigma.
* Long diagnostic delays often include medical gaslighting and misdiagnosis.

### Symptom Clusters

**Emotional:**

* Intense rage, irritability, mood swings.
* Sudden waves of hopelessness or despair.
* Anxiety, panic, or feeling out of control.

**Cognitive:**

* Brain fog and memory issues.
* Indecisiveness or overwhelm.
* Intrusive, self-critical, or suicidal thoughts.

**Physical:**

* Bloating, joint pain, migraines.
* Fatigue, breast tenderness.
* Digestive issues or flu-like malaise.

**Behavioral:**

* Withdrawal from social contact.
* Angry outbursts or tearful episodes.
* Suicidal ideation that lifts with menstruation.

**Timing:**

* Symptoms lift quickly with period onset.
* Repeats monthly, impacting entire reproductive lifespan.

### Real-World Experience

* "Losing myself" for 1–2 weeks every month.
* Strains on relationships, work performance, parenting.
* Suicidality often dismissed as hormonal.
* Deep shame, guilt, and self-doubt.
* Common misdiagnoses: BPD, Bipolar II, Depression.
* PMDD in trans men and NB folks often erased or stigmatized.

### Trauma Links & Origins

* High correlation with ACEs and trauma.
* Menstrual silence and shame across many cultures.
* Neurodivergent masking leads to burnout in luteal phase.
* Intergenerational trauma may contribute (epigenetics, modeling).

### Neurology & Physiology

* Estrogen/progesterone shifts affect serotonin, GABA.
* Brain overreacts to allopregnanolone in PMDD.
* Heightened stress response, neuroinflammation.
* Sleep disruption and circadian rhythm dysregulation.
* Luteal-phase brain imaging shows amygdala/PFC differences.
* Trans men may experience PMDD rebound if T is paused.

### Comorbidities & Differential Diagnosis

* **BPD:** Constant vs. cyclical symptoms.
* **Bipolar II:** Episodic but not cycle-linked.
* **Depression/Anxiety:** Chronic vs. predictable premenstrual window.
* **ADHD:** Executive dysfunction, sensory overload heightened pre-period.
* Mislabeling as "treatment-resistant depression" is common.
* Medical stigma and cultural misattribution delay correct diagnosis.

### Treatment & Healing

**SSRIs:**

* Can be taken luteally or continuously.
* Often rapid onset of relief in PMDD vs. MDD.

**Hormonal treatments:**

* Birth control (esp. drospirenone-based, continuous dosing).
* GnRH agonists or surgical options in severe cases.
* T therapy for trans men may halt cycles and symptoms.

**Lifestyle supports:**

* Exercise, sleep, magnesium, calcium, light therapy.
* Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, sugar premenstrually.

**Therapy approaches:**

* DBT for emotional regulation.
* IFS to engage "luteal self."
* Somatic and trauma-informed practices.

**Community and knowledge:**

* Symptom tracking = power.
* Peer support = solidarity.
* Self-care planning for luteal days.
* Full autonomy in treatment decisions (including surgical or gender-affirming care).

### Reframes & Recovery

* "It’s not all in your head — it’s in your brain and body."
* You’re not broken — you’re *sensitive* to normal shifts.
* Healing ≠ cure, but it *can* mean control, community, hope.
* Understanding the cycle brings freedom, not shame.
* Your resilience each month is proof of your strength.
