# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Plan – Kinri Project

---

## 🔑 1. Authentication & Access Control

- [ ] Confirm what authentication method is used (OAuth, email/password, etc.)
- [ ] Are sessions stored securely? (Secure, HttpOnly cookies or localStorage tokens)
- [ ] Are different roles (admin/user) defined and enforced?

---

## 🔒 2. Data Privacy & Compliance

- [ ] Is any PII (personally identifiable info) collected? (e.g., name, email)
- [ ] Does the app comply with HIPAA, GDPR, or CCPA?
- [ ] Are audit logs in place for user actions (logins, updates)?

---

## 🧪 3. Security Testing Plan

- [ ] Run [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) on local environment
- [ ] Test forms for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- [ ] Check API endpoints for:
  - [ ] Broken access control
  - [ ] Improper error handling
  - [ ] Unvalidated inputs

## 🧠 4. Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

| Threat | Example | Risk? | Mitigation |
|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| Spoofing | Fake login | Yes/No | Strong auth, MFA |
| Tampering | Modified requests | Yes/No | Input validation |
| Repudiation | No logging | Yes/No | Enable audit logs |
| Info Disclosure | Data leaks | Yes/No | Encrypt data in transit |
| DoS | Slow APIs | Yes/No | Rate limiting |
| Privilege Escalation | User→Admin | Yes/No | Role checks on backend |

---

## 🛠️ 5. Tools You Plan to Use

- [ ] OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite
- [ ] JWT.io (token validation)
- [ ] Postman (API security tests)
- [ ] GitHub Code Scanning or Secrets Detection
