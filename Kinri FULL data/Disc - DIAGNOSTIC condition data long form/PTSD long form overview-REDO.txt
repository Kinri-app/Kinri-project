PTSD Diagnostic Vault – MiFam Internal Longform
PART 1 of 5
(Clinical Criteria, Subtypes, and Symptom Clusters)

🧩 Clinical Criteria
Trauma is required for diagnosis across DSM-5 and ICD-10/11.

DSM-5:

Trauma = exposure to actual/threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence

Includes: direct experience, witnessing, learning it happened to a loved one, or repeated exposure (e.g. first responders)

ICD-11:

Trauma = exposure to extremely threatening or horrific event(s)

Slightly narrower: fewer peripheral symptoms, more focus on core trauma response

DSM-5 Symptom Clusters (4):

Intrusion: Flashbacks, nightmares, unwanted distressing memories

Avoidance: Of trauma reminders (internal or external)

Negative Cognitions & Mood: Guilt, shame, numbness, distorted beliefs

Hyperarousal/Reactivity: Startle, poor sleep, irritability, reckless behavior

ICD-11 Symptom Clusters (3):

Re-experiencing the trauma

Avoidance of reminders

Persistent sense of current threat

Specifiers & Durations:

DSM-5: Delayed onset, dissociative subtype, symptoms lasting >1 month

ICD-11: Streamlined criteria but separates out Complex PTSD

🧬 Subtypes
Dissociative Subtype (DSM-5)
Includes depersonalization (feeling unreal, disconnected from self)

And/or derealization (world feels unreal or distant)

Common in those with chronic or early trauma

Often co-occurs with emotional numbing, high-functioning masking

Complex PTSD (CPTSD – ICD-11)
Includes all standard PTSD symptoms plus:

Affective dysregulation (outbursts, numbness, shutdowns)

Negative self-concept (“I’m broken,” “I’m to blame”)

Interpersonal disturbances (avoidance, fear, emotional detachment)

CPTSD tends to arise from chronic interpersonal trauma, such as:

Childhood abuse

Domestic violence

Human trafficking

Torture, captivity, war imprisonment

DSM-5 does not formally recognize CPTSD as a diagnosis — symptoms get spread across PTSD, BPD, depression, etc.

🌪️ Symptom Clusters & Real-World Experience
🔁 Intrusions
Flashbacks: “Reliving” the trauma, full sensory and emotional intensity

Nightmares: Can be literal or symbolic

Intrusive memories/images: Unwanted and distressing

Physiological reactivity to reminders (e.g. heart racing when passing the assault site)

🚪 Avoidance
External: Avoiding people, places, conversations, or media related to trauma

Internal: Shutting down thoughts or emotions related to it

May lead to isolation, self-distraction, or substance use

⚠️ Hyperarousal
Hypervigilance: Constant scanning for danger

Exaggerated startle: Jumps easily at noises, touch

Insomnia or disrupted sleep

Irritability, aggressive outbursts

Recklessness: Fast driving, risky sex, substance use

Difficulty concentrating or remembering details

🧱 Negative Mood & Cognitions (DSM only)
Persistent guilt or shame

Feeling detached from others

Blaming oneself or others for the trauma

Belief that the world is completely dangerous

Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities

Inability to feel joy, love, or satisfaction
 Flashbacks vs Intrusions vs Dissociation
🔹 Intrusions
Sudden, distressing memories/images

You still know it’s a memory, even if upsetting

Often verbal or visual: “I keep seeing it happen in my head”

🔹 Flashbacks
Full-body reliving

Feels like the event is happening right now

Loss of awareness of present time/place

Can be partial (emotional flooding) or full (screaming, hiding, reacting physically)

The body reacts like it’s under threat again

🔹 Dissociation
General disconnection from self or surroundings

Depersonalization: “I’m not real / not in my body”

Derealization: “This world isn’t real / I’m in a dream”

Can involve memory loss (dissociative amnesia)

Common during or after trauma — brain “checks out” for protection

🧒 Age Differences
🧒 Children
Trauma reenactment in play or drawings

Clinginess, regression (bedwetting, thumb-sucking)

Somatic symptoms: headaches, stomachaches

May not verbalize trauma

🧑 Adolescents
Risk-taking: drugs, sex, aggression

Drop in school performance

May be mislabeled as “bad behavior” or “oppositional”

Increased suicide risk if PTSD is untreated

🧔 Adults
Stronger verbal/cognitive symptoms

Intrusive memories more prominent than reenactment

Often experience shame, guilt, avoidance, numbness

⚧️ Gender Differences
♀️ Women
2x more likely to develop PTSD than men

More internalizing: anxiety, guilt, dissociation

Trauma often interpersonal (e.g. sexual abuse, domestic violence)

More likely to seek therapy

♂️ Men
More externalizing: anger, aggression, substance use

More likely to suppress emotion

Higher prevalence of combat, accident trauma

Less likely to disclose symptoms or seek help

🎭 High-Functioning / Masked PTSD
Appears successful or “fine” on the outside

May excel at work, caregiving, or managing crises

Internally: nightmares, panic attacks, numbing, hypervigilance

Uses overcontrol, perfectionism, distraction

Rarely asks for help — often praised for resilience, which reinforces silence

Collapses may occur later if coping mechanisms fail

⚖️ Comorbidities & Common Overlaps
🧨 Mood/Anxiety Disorders
Depression: Guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness

GAD/Panic: Constant worry, body tension, hyperarousal

Often co-occurs, reinforcing emotional shutdown

🍷 Substance Use
Self-medicating to escape flashbacks, anxiety, or numbness

Alcohol, opioids, stimulants commonly used

Substance use increases risk of retraumatization

😖 Chronic Pain / Fibromyalgia
Trauma stored in the body → tension, inflammation

PTSD linked to IBS, headaches, muscle pain

Pain often flares with stress or trauma triggers

🔁 OCD / Eating Disorders
Compulsions may form around control, safety, or ritual

Eating disorders can be a control mechanism or body-based trauma response

🔀 Diagnostic Confusions
BPD: Both involve emotional reactivity, impulsivity, dissociation, self-harm — but BPD centers on abandonment and identity instability

ASD (Acute Stress Disorder): Symptoms occur <1 month post-trauma

DID: Multiple identity states, significant memory gaps — trauma is usually early and extreme

Psychosis: Flashbacks or dissociation can resemble hallucinations — but PTSD patients usually retain insight (“I felt like I was back there” vs “I am back there”)

🧠 Neurobiological Changes in PTSD
🧨 Amygdala
Brain's alarm system — detects threats

Overactive in PTSD → constant false alarms

Hyper-responsiveness = exaggerated fear, startle, anxiety

🧠 Hippocampus
Encodes memory & context

Often shrinks in PTSD

Can’t distinguish “then” from “now” → flashbacks, fragmented memory

Memories feel present, not past

🧠 Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)
Logical, emotional regulator (“brake system”)

Underactive in PTSD → poor emotional control, impaired fear extinction

Explains: “I know I’m safe, but I can’t feel safe”

💉 HPA Axis Dysfunction
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis = stress hormone system

Cortisol either:

Stays elevated → chronic stress

Drops too low → burnout, immune suppression

Adrenaline spikes → restlessness, rage, insomnia

Over time, contributes to autoimmune, GI, and heart issues

🔌 Polyvagal Theory & Nervous System
Vagal Pathways:
Ventral Vagal (safe & social) → calm, connected

Sympathetic (danger) → fight/flight

Dorsal Vagal (life threat) → freeze/collapse

PTSD often causes:

Stuck in fight/flight: panic, rage, insomnia

Or freeze/shutdown: numb, dissociated, depressive

Signs of Polyvagal Imbalance
Constant hyperawareness or freeze

Social withdrawal

Poor vagal tone = low resilience to stress

Recovery Implications
Safe co-regulation helps restore ventral vagal state

Tools: eye contact, soothing voices, breathwork, physical rhythm (walking, drumming, rocking)

🧒 ACEs & Developmental Trauma
ACEs = Adverse Childhood Experiences
Abuse, neglect, household dysfunction

High ACE score = greater risk for:

PTSD

Depression/anxiety

Addiction

Heart disease

Early death

Effects of Early Trauma
Brain architecture develops under threat

Hypervigilance, poor emotional regulation

Attachment system disrupted: distrust, disorganized bonds

CPTSD and personality fragmentation common

Neglect vs Event-Based Trauma
Neglect (emotional or physical) can be just as traumatic

Lack of attunement = developmental voids

Often overlooked but leads to long-term emotional dysregulation

🧍 Somatic Markers of Trauma
“The body keeps the score” — trauma stored in muscles, fascia, organs

Symptoms include:

Chronic pain/tension (neck, jaw, back)

Migraines, gut issues, IBS

Chronic fatigue

Breath-holding, shallow breathing

Restlessness or frozen stillness

Somatic flashbacks = body remembers even when mind doesn't

Triggers can be physical: scent, touch, body position

Somatic Survival Responses
Startle reflex: flinching, ducking, sudden heart spikes

Freeze/collapse: shutdown, heaviness, detachment

Fight/flight activation: pacing, clenched fists/jaw, rage

Sensory flashbacks: “I feel it again in my stomach/throat/skin”

Attachment & Trust Wounds
Trauma — especially interpersonal — shatters core trust

Survivors may:

Avoid closeness (“People = danger”)

Cling tightly (“Please don’t leave me”)

Constantly second-guess others' motives

Fear of betrayal, abandonment, rejection

Hypervigilant for signs of being hurt again

💏 Intimacy & Sexuality
Touch and closeness = triggers

Sexual trauma:

Touch may feel violating

“Freeze” response activates during intimacy

Shame, disgust toward own body

Other trauma:

Emotional unavailability

Shutdowns during sex

Aversion to being vulnerable

👪 Parenting Under PTSD
Can swing between extremes:

Overprotection (“Nothing bad will ever happen to my kids”)

Detachment (“I love them, but I feel nothing”)

Common triggers:

Child reaching same age as parent's trauma

Loud crying, tantrums, unpredictability

Kids may internalize: “I make mum/dad upset”

Risk of repeating generational trauma if unaddressed

But: trauma-aware parents often deeply empathetic and protective once supported

🪞 Trauma & Self-Identity
PTSD warps the sense of self

Common self-beliefs:

“I’m broken”

“It was my fault”

“I’m disgusting/weak/unlovable”

Survivor identity can be:

Empowering (“I lived”)

Limiting (“I’ll never be more than this”)

Some feel “frozen” at the age of the trauma

Memory fragmentation affects coherence: “I don’t know who I am”

😞 Shame & Guilt
Shame = “I am bad”

Guilt = “I did something bad”

PTSD survivors may feel:

“I should’ve fought harder”

“I let it happen”

“Others had it worse, I’m weak”

Survivor’s guilt: “Why did I live when they didn’t?”

These beliefs fuel isolation and depression

💊 Evidence-Based Therapies
🔁 Prolonged Exposure (PE)
Safely and gradually face avoided memories/triggers

Habituate the nervous system

Reduces fear and avoidance loops

🧠 Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
Identify and challenge “stuck points”

Example: “It was my fault” → “I did what I could to survive”

Helps reframe guilt, shame, trust beliefs

🧒 Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT)
Youth-specific

Includes caregivers

Combines coping skills + exposure + trauma narrative

👁️ EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing)
Recall traumatic memory while following bilateral stimulation

“Unlocks” the trauma and reprocesses it

Memory loses its emotional intensity

Popular because no need to retell full narrative repeatedly

🧩 Internal Family Systems (IFS)
Works with “parts” (e.g., angry part, protector, exiled child)

Heals by creating internal dialogue and trust

Useful in CPTSD or dissociative cases

🧘 Somatic Therapies
Somatic Experiencing (SE): Track sensations, release trauma energy

TRE: Evoke tremors to discharge survival responses

Trauma-informed Yoga: Grounding through breath and posture

Sensorimotor Psychotherapy: Combines somatic and attachment work

💊 Medication Supports
SSRIs: Sertraline, Paroxetine — first-line for mood/anxiety/PTSD

Prazosin: Great for trauma nightmares

SNRIs: Venlafaxine — sometimes used

Beta-blockers / Antipsychotics: Off-label for extreme arousal/anger

MDMA-Assisted Therapy (experimental):

Opens trust, compassion during trauma processing

High remission rates in trials

🌱 Lifestyle & Peer-Based Healing
Group therapy / peer circles

Normalizes symptoms

Breaks shame

Spiritual practice / ritual

Sense of meaning, release

Nature, movement, routine

Daily grounding

Nervous system regulation

Animals

Unconditional co-regulation

Trauma service dogs can interrupt flashbacks

 Trauma-Informed Care
Shift from: “What’s wrong with you?”
To: “What happened to you?”

Core principles:

Safety (physical + emotional)

Trustworthiness

Choice and collaboration

Empowerment

Cultural humility

In practice:

Always explain what you're doing

Offer choices wherever possible

Watch for nonverbal distress

Don't push trauma stories before trust is built

Avoid using authority or force — it echoes abusers

🔁 Avoiding Re-Traumatization
Happens when current interactions replicate the dynamics of past trauma

Loss of control

Invalidation

Invasive procedures

Harsh tone or judgment

Examples:

Medical exams without proper consent

Courtrooms that force graphic retelling

Shelters with authoritarian rules

Therapy that dives in too deep, too fast

Prevent it with:

Grounding techniques

Opt-outs

Permission-based processes

Consistent respect

🚫 Misdiagnosis & Invalidation
Commonly misdiagnosed as:

BPD

ADHD

Bipolar II

Psychosis

Especially common in:

Women

Neurodivergent individuals

People of color

Invalidation compounds trauma:

“You’re overreacting”

“That was a long time ago”

“Others had it worse”

“It doesn’t sound traumatic to me”

Healing starts with:

Being believed

Being listened to

Being honored for surviving

🌍 Systemic & Collective Trauma
War, Conflict, Displacement
Veterans, refugees, civilians

Complex grief, moral injury, cultural dislocation

“Delayed PTSD” common after war ends

Domestic & Sexual Violence
Often ongoing, repetitive

Systemic barriers to justice

May be retraumatized by police, courts, media

Medical Trauma
Painful procedures

Forced treatment

Being ignored or dismissed

Especially prevalent in childbirth, psychiatric settings, disability care

Racial & Intergenerational Trauma
Historical atrocities leave epigenetic and cultural scars

Everyday microaggressions build into chronic stress

Collective trauma passed down through family lines

🧠 PTSD in Neurodivergent Individuals
Autism:

May experience non-traditional trauma (sensory overload, forced compliance)

Symptoms often missed or misread

Expression may be more physical or behavioral

ADHD:

May develop PTSD from repeated failure or punishment

Emotional dysregulation overlaps

High impulsivity increases risk of exposure to trauma

Key Issues:

Less likely to be believed

More likely to be misunderstood

May need adapted therapy (visuals, pacing, fewer metaphors)

🌱 Reframing & Post-Traumatic Growth
PTSD symptoms = adaptations that helped you survive

Hypervigilance = “I had to stay alert”

Numbness = “I couldn’t afford to feel it all”

Flashbacks = “My brain trying to process unfinished danger”

Survivor > Victim — but growth is not obligatory

PTG (Post-Traumatic Growth) may include:

Greater compassion

Reordered priorities

New life purpose

Stronger boundaries

Connection to spirituality

Identity clarity (“This changed me, but didn’t break me”)

Recovery = not the erasure of scars, but the integration of pain into a fuller self
