    "question": "What is overstimulation in the context of ADHD?",
    "answer": "Overstimulation happens when the brain receives too much sensory, emotional, or cognitive input to process at once, leading to overwhelm, shutdown, or irritability.",
    "tags": [
      "ADHD",
      "overstimulation",
      "sensory overload"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are ADHD brains more prone to sensory overload?",
    "answer": "ADHD brains have a harder time filtering out irrelevant stimuli, so all input comes in at once\u2014making environments feel more intense and harder to manage.",

      "sensory sensitivity",

    "question": "What are common signs of overstimulation in ADHD?",
    "answer": "Irritability, shutdown, zoning out, snapping at others, or needing to escape a situation are common signs of overstimulation in ADHD.",

  {
    "question": "How does emotional overstimulation affect ADHD individuals?",
    "answer": "Strong emotions can be just as overwhelming as loud noises or bright lights, leading to emotional flooding and difficulty processing feelings in the moment.",

      "emotional flooding",
      "regulation",
      "affect"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What environments can trigger overstimulation for ADHD brains?",
    "answer": "Busy stores, loud events, social gatherings, or chaotic homes can all trigger overstimulation due to high sensory and social demands.",
    "tags": [
      "triggers",
      "environment",
      "stimuli"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is multitasking overwhelming for ADHD individuals?",
    "answer": "Switching attention quickly between tasks increases cognitive load, making it easy to become overwhelmed and lose track of what\u2019s important.",

      "task switching",
      "cognitive load",
      "executive function"
    ]

  {
    "question": "What helps manage overstimulation in ADHD?",
    "answer": "Breaks, quiet spaces, noise-canceling headphones, deep pressure, and reducing screen time can all help reduce overstimulation.",

      "regulation tools",
      "sensory strategies",
      "self-care"
    ]

  {
    "question": "How can routines reduce overstimulation risk?",
    "answer": "Predictable routines reduce uncertainty and limit exposure to unexpected sensory and emotional input, which helps regulate the nervous system.",

      "routine",
      "predictability",
      "nervous system"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does rest play in preventing overstimulation?",
    "answer": "Regular rest, sleep, and downtime replenish mental and emotional resources, making it easier to tolerate stimulation without becoming overwhelmed.",

      "recovery",
      "sleep",
      "resilience"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Is overstimulation a sign of weakness?",
    "answer": "No. It\u2019s a sign that the brain is receiving too much input at once. Recognizing this and taking steps to reduce input is a strength, not a flaw.",
