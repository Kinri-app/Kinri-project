    "question": "What are the limitations of current microbiome tests?",
    "answer": "They often can't measure function or activity, may miss some species, and results can vary widely between labs and testing methods.",

  {
    "question": "Can microbiome results change quickly?",
    "answer": "Yes. The microbiome shifts with diet, sleep, stress, medication, and environment \u2014 so a test reflects a moment in time, not a fixed state.",

    "question": "What\u2019s more important than a test result?",
