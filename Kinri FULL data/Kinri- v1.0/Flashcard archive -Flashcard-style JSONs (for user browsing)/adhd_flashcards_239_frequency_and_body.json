    "question": "What does 'frequency' refer to in the context of ADHD and the body?",
    "answer": "It refers to the repeated activation or stimulation of certain physiological or neurological systems, such as dopamine circuits, stress responses, or sensory inputs, which can influence how the ADHD brain regulates attention, energy, and emotion.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why does the ADHD brain often seek high-frequency stimulation?",
    "answer": "Due to low baseline dopamine levels, the ADHD brain may crave stimulation to achieve a state of focus or interest. Frequent input (movement, sound, novelty) helps temporarily boost dopamine and maintain engagement.",

  {
    "question": "How does frequent movement help with ADHD symptoms?",
    "answer": "Regular physical movement increases dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, helping improve mood, focus, and emotional regulation in individuals with ADHD.",

  {
    "question": "What role does frequency play in managing routines for ADHD?",
    "answer": "Repeated daily rhythms (e.g., wake/sleep cycles, meal timing, exercise) help regulate the ADHD nervous system and reduce stress. Inconsistent frequencies can lead to dysregulation.",

  {
    "question": "Can the body become overstimulated by high-frequency input?",
    "answer": "Yes. While frequent stimulation can help focus, too much input (noise, lights, demands) can overwhelm the nervous system, leading to shutdowns or emotional outbursts.",

  {
    "question": "How do body-based practices like breathwork or drumming support ADHD regulation through frequency?",
    "answer": "These practices use rhythmic, predictable input to soothe the nervous system, regulate breathing, and create a safe sense of embodiment \u2014 all beneficial for ADHD.",

  {
    "question": "What is 'entrainment' and how does it relate to frequency and ADHD?",
    "answer": "Entrainment is the process by which bodily rhythms sync to external patterns (like music, walking pace, or another person\u2019s tone). It can help calm or energize an ADHD system by aligning internal states with predictable external frequencies.",

  {
    "question": "Why is frequent sensory input sometimes grounding for ADHD individuals?",
    "answer": "Repetitive sensory input (fidgeting, music, texture) provides consistent feedback to the brain, helping ADHD individuals stay present and regulate attention.",

    "question": "How can frequency-based interventions support ADHD children in school?",
    "answer": "Scheduled movement breaks, rhythmic music, and frequent check-ins support nervous system regulation and can improve focus and behavior in ADHD kids.",

  {
    "question": "How can caregivers use frequency intentionally to support ADHD regulation?",
    "answer": "By embedding regular, predictable rhythms into daily life (meals, hugs, transitions), caregivers can reduce chaos and provide a felt sense of safety for ADHD individuals.",
