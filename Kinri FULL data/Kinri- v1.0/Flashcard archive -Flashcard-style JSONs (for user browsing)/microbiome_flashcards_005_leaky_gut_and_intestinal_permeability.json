    "question": "What is leaky gut?",
    "answer": "Leaky gut, or increased intestinal permeability, occurs when the gut lining becomes damaged, allowing undigested food, toxins, and microbes to enter the bloodstream.",

      "leaky gut",
      "intestinal permeability",
      "gut barrier"
    ]

  {
    "question": "What causes the gut lining to become 'leaky'?",
    "answer": "Stress, processed foods, infections, alcohol, medications (like NSAIDs), and dysbiosis can all weaken the gut lining.",

    "question": "What symptoms are associated with leaky gut?",
    "answer": "Bloating, fatigue, food sensitivities, joint pain, brain fog, and skin issues are commonly linked to increased gut permeability.",

  {
    "question": "How does leaky gut relate to chronic inflammation?",
    "answer": "When unwanted substances cross the gut barrier, the immune system responds \u2014 triggering widespread inflammation over time.",

      "immune system",
      "barrier dysfunction"

  {
    "question": "Can leaky gut contribute to autoimmune diseases?",
    "answer": "Some theories suggest that leaky gut may trigger immune confusion, contributing to the onset or worsening of autoimmune conditions.",

      "immune dysfunction"

  {
    "question": "What role does zonulin play in leaky gut?",
    "answer": "Zonulin is a protein that regulates tight junctions in the gut wall \u2014 when overexpressed, it increases permeability.",

      "zonulin",
      "tight junctions",
      "gut lining"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "How is leaky gut diagnosed?",
    "answer": "There's no gold-standard test, but some practitioners use lactulose/mannitol urine tests, zonulin levels, or symptom-based assessments.",

  {
    "question": "What foods may worsen gut permeability?",
    "answer": "Highly processed foods, refined sugar, gluten, alcohol, and artificial additives may increase permeability in sensitive individuals.",

  {
    "question": "How can you support healing a leaky gut?",
    "answer": "Remove irritants, restore healthy microbes with prebiotics/probiotics, repair the lining with nutrients like glutamine and zinc, and rebalance lifestyle factors.",

  {
    "question": "Is leaky gut recognized by conventional medicine?",
    "answer": "While intestinal permeability is scientifically studied, 'leaky gut' as a diagnosis is more commonly used in integrative and functional medicine.",
