    "question": "How does the microbiome support the immune system?",
    "answer": "The microbiome trains immune cells, defends against pathogens, and regulates inflammation to maintain immune balance.",

    "question": "What is immune tolerance and how does the microbiome influence it?",
    "answer": "Immune tolerance is the ability to avoid attacking harmless substances. A diverse microbiome helps the immune system learn what is safe.",

    "question": "How does dysbiosis affect immunity?",
    "answer": "An imbalanced microbiome can lead to chronic inflammation, increased infection risk, and a higher chance of autoimmune conditions.",

  {
    "question": "What role do short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play in immunity?",
    "answer": "SCFAs, produced by gut bacteria, reduce inflammation and help maintain the gut barrier \u2014 both essential for immune regulation.",

    "question": "How does the microbiome prevent infections?",
    "answer": "Healthy microbes compete with harmful pathogens for space and resources, producing antimicrobial compounds and blocking invaders.",

  {
    "question": "Can antibiotics weaken the immune system?",
    "answer": "Yes. Antibiotics disrupt beneficial microbes, which can reduce immune resilience and increase vulnerability to infections or allergies.",

      "immune disruption",
      "microbiome damage"
    ]

  {
    "question": "What is the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)?",
    "answer": "GALT is immune tissue in the gut lining that works closely with the microbiome to monitor and respond to microbial signals.",

  {
    "question": "Why is early-life microbiome development important for immunity?",
    "answer": "A healthy early microbiome helps train the immune system to respond appropriately, reducing future risk of allergies or autoimmunity.",

    "question": "How does diet impact immune-microbiome interactions?",
    "answer": "Fiber, polyphenols, and fermented foods feed microbes that support immune function, while processed foods can fuel inflammation.",

      "immune nutrition",
      "gut health"

  {
    "question": "Can improving gut health strengthen immunity?",
    "answer": "Yes. Enhancing microbial diversity through diet and lifestyle supports immune resilience and reduces chronic inflammation.",
