## Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) â€“ Diagnostic Vault Entry

### ðŸ”¹ Core Diagnostic Criteria

* Persistent excessive anxiety across multiple domains, lasting 6+ months.
* Difficulty controlling the worry, which causes functional impairment.
* Disproportionate to actual threat; not limited to one area (e.g., social or health).
* Cultural & gender framing: includes somatic anxiety, masked worry, and gendered expressions.
* DSM-5 and ICD-11 aligned but differ slightly in functional vs. physical emphasis.

### ðŸ”¹ Symptom Clusters

* "What if" thought spirals; catastrophic thinking.
* Physical: muscle tension, fatigue, GI issues, sleep disturbances.
* Cognitive: decision paralysis, hypervigilance, irritability, mental blanking.

### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Experience

* Invisible load: constant preoccupation and anticipatory dread.
* High-functioning masking: perfectionism, reassurance-seeking, people-pleasing.
* Chronic mental fatigue from over-preparing and micromanaging.
* Relationship strain, difficulty parenting while anxious, workplace burnout.

### ðŸ”¹ Trauma Links & Origins

* Early attachment wounds, controlling or chaotic childhoods.
* Inherited sensitivity or learned fear response.
* Anxiety as a protective response to trauma or unpredictability.
* Sensitivity and vigilance as survival adaptations.

### ðŸ”¹ Neurology & Physiology

* Overactive amygdala, underactive prefrontal cortex.
* HPA axis: cortisol and adrenaline overload.
* Somatic stress: GI dysfunction, headaches, sleep disruption.
* Polyvagal lens: stuck in sympathetic fight/flight mode.

### ðŸ”¹ Comorbidities & Differential Diagnosis

* Often co-occurs with depression, ADHD, OCD, PTSD/CPTSD.
* Differentiated by scope (broad worry vs. targeted fears or trauma triggers).
* Common misdiagnoses in neurodivergent or gender-masked presentations.

### ðŸ”¹ Treatment & Healing

* CBT: restructuring thoughts, challenging worry logic.
* ACT: mindfulness and values-based behavior.
* Somatic tools: breathwork, muscle relaxation, vagal toning.
* IFS: compassionately dialoguing with anxious parts.
* Lifestyle: sleep, nutrition, exercise, reducing overstimulation.
* Medication: SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone, beta-blockers (short-term).
* Rewiring: neuroplasticity through gradual exposure, self-soothing.
* Connection: co-regulation, community, therapeutic presence.

### ðŸ”¹ Reframes & Recovery

* "You're not weak â€” you're wired to care."
* Sensitivity reframed as strength.
* Befriend the inner worrier: from enemy to protector.
* Healing is non-linear but possible; setbacks are not failure.

### ðŸ”¹ Closing Affirmations

* "My feelings are valid."
* "In this moment, I am safe."
* "I am stronger than my anxiety."
* "I treat myself with compassion."
* "Healing is happening, even when I can't see it."
