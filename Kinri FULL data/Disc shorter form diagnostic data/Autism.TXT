## Autism Diagnostic Vault – MiFam

### 1. Clinical Criteria

* **DSM-5:**

  * Core domains: (A) social communication deficits, (B) restricted/repetitive behaviors
  * Must meet all 3 social criteria + at least 2 of 4 behavior criteria
  * Specifiers: intellectual/language impairments, severity levels

* **ICD-10:**

  * Separate categories: Childhood Autism, Asperger’s, Atypical Autism, etc.
  * Requires symptom onset before age 3 (for Childhood Autism)
  * Social + communication + RRBs evaluated separately

* **ICD-11:**

  * Unified ASD diagnosis (like DSM-5)
  * No strict age 3 cutoff, but symptoms must emerge during developmental period
  * Includes sensory reactivity; specifiers for ID and language level

* **Key Differences:**

  * ICD-10 uses subtypes, DSM-5/ICD-11 use spectrum
  * ICD-11 merges social/communication domain; includes sensory issues

### 2. Real-World Symptoms

* **Child vs Adult:**

  * Children: delays in eye contact, pretend play, meltdowns, routine rigidity
  * Adults: masking, subtle social misunderstandings, burnout, anxiety

* **Masking & Camouflage:**

  * Especially common in girls and late-diagnosed adults
  * Leads to exhaustion, misdiagnosis, or delayed diagnosis

* **Overt Traits:**

  * Echolalia, stimming, meltdowns, speech delays, clear routine needs

* **Subtle Traits:**

  * Literal thinking, need for clarity, social fatigue, “quirky” interests

* **Behavioral & Sensory Examples:**

  * Preference for sameness, distress at change
  * Sensory hypersensitivity or seeking (e.g. sounds, textures)
  * Stimming used for self-regulation

### 3. Commonly Confused Conditions

* **ADHD vs ASD:**

  * ADHD = inattention/impulsivity; ASD = social decoding difficulty + RRBs
  * ADHDers seek novelty; autistics seek predictability

* **OCD vs ASD:**

  * OCD compulsions = anxiety-driven; ASD routines = comfort-driven
  * OCD = ego-dystonic; ASD = ego-syntonic

* **Social Anxiety vs ASD:**

  * Anxiety = fear of judgment; ASD = difference in social understanding

* **GAD vs ASD:**

  * GAD = constant worry; ASD = sensory/social stress-driven anxiety

* **Schizoid PD vs ASD:**

  * Schizoid = true disinterest in people; ASD = social struggle, not apathy

* **Other Confusions:**

  * Language disorders, Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder
  * Reactive Attachment Disorder, Avoidant Personality, Schizotypal PD

### 4. Comorbidities

* **Neurodevelopmental:**

  * ADHD (\~50%+ comorbidity)
  * Intellectual Disability (\~30–40%)

* **Psychiatric:**

  * Anxiety (\~30–40%), Depression (\~20–30%)
  * OCD, Bipolar (\~11%), Schizophrenia (\~5–7%)

* **Medical:**

  * Epilepsy (20–30%), GI issues (20–70%)
  * Sleep disorders (50–80%)

* **Other:**

  * Sensory processing, Feeding/Eating issues, Motor coordination problems

---

### 5. Neuroscience

* **Brain Structure & Connectivity:**

  * Early overgrowth, altered pruning, local overconnectivity, long-range underconnectivity

* **Region-Specific Differences:**

  * Amygdala, fusiform gyrus, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, mirror neuron system

* **Cognitive Theories:**

  * Theory of Mind Deficit (Mindblindness)
  * Executive Dysfunction
  * Weak Central Coherence
  * Predictive Coding / Intense World Theory

* **Genetics & Neurodevelopment:**

  * High heritability (70–80%)
  * Syndromes: Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, Rett, Down Syndrome
  * Polygenic & de novo mutations; prenatal influences

---

### 6. Real-Life Examples

* Sensory overload in public (supermarket meltdown)
* Masking and burnout in working adult
* Special interest monologue in teenager
* Morning routine disruption (meltdown from change)
* Public stimming & misunderstanding
* Literal communication misfire (sarcasm misread)
* Meltdown vs tantrum (emotion overflow)

---

### 7. Treatments & Supports

* **Medical:**

  * For comorbidities: stimulants, SSRIs, antipsychotics (Risperidone), melatonin, etc.

* **Therapies:**

  * ABA (modern forms), ESDM, Floortime, PRT
  * Speech therapy (including AAC)
  * OT (sensory integration, daily living)
  * PT (motor development)
  * CBT (adapted)
  * Social skills groups

* **Education:**

  * IEPs, visual supports, structured teaching (TEACCH), life skills training

* **Environmental:**

  * Sensory-friendly spaces, visual schedules, timers, AAC, routines
  * Accommodations (headphones, stim tools, fidgets, quiet zones)

* **Holistic:**

  * Diet (with caution), exercise, mindfulness, music/art therapy
  * Community inclusion, family education/support

---

### 8. Sensitivity Areas

* **Stigma & Language:**

  * Identity-first vs person-first; avoid “suffers from” or “high-functioning”
  * Embrace neurodiversity

* **Gendered Presentation:**

  * Girls, women, and nonbinary individuals often mask; underdiagnosed
  * “Female phenotype” includes social mimicry, internalized distress

* **Trauma Intersection:**

  * Autistics vulnerable to trauma; trauma-informed care is essential
  * Masking, restraint, or misunderstanding can create long-term distress

* **Late Diagnosis:**

  * Brings relief + grief; reframe history with compassion
  * Identity shifts and self-acceptance journey

* **Respect & Autonomy:**

  * Include autistic voices, honor sensory preferences, support communication modes
  * Focus on strengths and self-determined goals
