## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) â€” Diagnostic Vault Entry

### ðŸ”¹ Core Diagnostic Criteria

* OCD involves intrusive obsessions and compulsions that form a self-perpetuating anxiety-relief cycle.
* Criteria from DSM-5, ICD-10, and ICD-11 include time-consuming rituals, distress, and impaired function.
* Obsessions = intrusive thoughts/images/urges; Compulsions = behaviors/mental rituals to neutralize distress.
* Insight specifiers range from full awareness to delusional conviction.
* Misdiagnoses: GAD, autism, ADHD, trauma responses.
* Cultural/gender expression: scrupulosity, shame-based OCD, somatic checking.

### ðŸ”¹ Symptom Clusters

* Obsessions: contamination, harm, taboo sexual/moral thoughts, symmetry, somatic.
* Compulsions: visible (washing, checking) and internal (counting, praying, mental reviews).
* "Pure-O" = internal rituals with no visible behaviors.
* Avoidance and reassurance-seeking are secondary compulsions.
* Insight ranges from awareness to complete belief in obsessions.
* OCD themes morph over time, changing content but maintaining cycle.

### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Experience

* Feels like a mental bully, constant fear and dread.
* Shame and guilt over intrusive thoughts.
* "Pure-O" is isolating, with no outward signs of rituals.
* Disrupts daily life, work, and relationships.
* Isolation, secrecy, and fear of being seen as "crazy."
* OCD as survival strategy in a brain hijacked by fear.

### ðŸ”¹ Trauma Links & Origins

* Early chaos or control deprivation can set OCD foundations.
* Moral/religious purity teachings amplify scrupulosity.
* Trauma (CPTSD) may trigger or worsen OCD.
* Magical thinking as childlike coping mechanism carried into adulthood.
* Neurodivergence and attachment wounds can feed into OCD's grip.

### ðŸ”¹ Neurology & Physiology

* CSTC circuit dysfunction (brain loop gets "stuck").
* Hyperactive anterior cingulate cortex: persistent error signals.
* Neurotransmitters: serotonin (main), glutamate, dopamine.
* Sleep, stress, immune system influence OCD severity.
* OCD is neurologically distinct from anxiety and psychosis.

### ðŸ”¹ Comorbidities & Differential Diagnosis

* Depression, GAD, Panic, Social Anxiety.
* ADHD: shared traits but different motivation behind behavior.
* Autism: rituals vs compulsions, sensory vs fear-driven.
* PTSD/CPTSD: flashbacks vs imagined catastrophes.
* Psychosis: OCD with poor insight vs delusional thinking.
* Body-focused disorders: BDD, Trichotillomania, Dermatillomania.
* Perinatal/Postpartum OCD: taboo thoughts + parental fear.
* OCD vs OCPD: ego-dystonic vs ego-syntonic behaviors.
* Intrusive thoughts â‰  suicidal/violent intent.
* Cultural misinterpretations (e.g., spiritual crises).

### ðŸ”¹ Treatment & Healing

* ERP (Exposure & Response Prevention) = gold standard.
* ACT (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy): thought defusion.
* CBT: cognitive restructuring, paired with behavioral change.
* IFS and somatic work for trauma-linked OCD.
* Medication: SSRIs (high dose), sometimes antipsychotic add-ons.
* Emerging: ketamine, psilocybin, DBS for treatment-resistant cases.
* Lifestyle support: sleep, nutrition, nervous system regulation.
* Community and peer support reduce shame and isolation.
* Family involvement can reduce accommodation and support ERP.

### ðŸ”¹ Reframes & Recovery

* OCD is fear-based, not about tidiness.
* Intrusive thoughts are alarms, not secret desires.
* Compulsions are survival tactics, not flaws.
* Recovery = building tolerance for uncertainty.
* You are not your thoughts â€” healing is possible.
* Many recover and go on to lead meaningful, empowered lives.
