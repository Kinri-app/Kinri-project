## Bipolar II Diagnostic Vault

### Core Diagnostic Criteria

* Global recognition (DSM-5, ICD-11): At least one hypomanic and one major depressive episode.
* Bipolar I vs II: Bipolar II lacks full-blown mania; instead, hypomania and severe depressive episodes dominate.
* Hypomania vs mania: Hypomania = elevated mood/energy without psychosis; Mania = longer, disruptive, may include delusions.
* Depression in Bipolar II: Often severe, high suicide risk, mistaken for unipolar depression.
* Importance of longitudinal assessment: Diagnosing requires full mood history over time, not a single moment.
* Gender/cultural mislabeling: Women misdiagnosed as BPD or “moody”; creatives as eccentric; spiritual highs mistaken for enlightenment.

### Symptom Clusters

* Hypomania: Elevated or irritable mood, energy spikes, impulsivity, decreased need for sleep.
* Depression: Anhedonia, fatigue, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts.
* Mixed features: Agitation, anxiety, despair, restlessness.
* Cyclical nature: Rapid cycling, seasonal swings, instability.
* High-functioning vs impulsive hypomania: Some channel energy productively, others spiral into risk.

### Real-World Experience

* Inside hypomania: Creativity, confidence, insomnia, fast speech, euphoria or irritability.
* Inside depression: Isolation, numbness, fatigue, shame, passive or active suicidality.
* Productivity spikes: Hypomania fuels intense bursts.
* Crashes: Aftermath includes regret, guilt, depressive plunge.
* Relationship strain: Love-bombing followed by withdrawal.
* Self-medication & delay: Alcohol, cannabis, stimulants used to cope; diagnosis often missed for years.
* “Smiling” depression: Outwardly functional while inwardly suicidal.

### Trauma Links & Origins

* Childhood instability: Abuse, neglect, and invalidation shape later mood patterns.
* Trauma vs Bipolar II: Trauma reactions mimic mood swings; key difference is episodic vs trigger-linked patterns.
* CPTSD overlaps: Intense emotions, impulsivity, but driven by memory/fear.
* Generational patterns: Genetic + environmental trauma passed down.
* Fight-flight-fawn fusion: Trauma responses mirror hypomania (fight/flight) and depression (freeze/fawn).

### Neurology & Physiology

* Brain systems: Amygdala, PFC, limbic loops involved in mood regulation.
* Neurotransmitters: Dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA all dysregulated.
* Sleep/circadian rhythm: Disrupted sleep can trigger episodes; rhythm sensitivity common.
* Hormonal/seasonal: PMS, postpartum, winter depression, and thyroid links.
* Kindling effect: Untreated episodes may worsen over time.

### Comorbidities & Differential Diagnosis

* BPD: Mood swings in response to triggers vs spontaneous episodes.
* ADHD: Constant vs episodic impulsivity, energy, and distractibility.
* PTSD/CPTSD: Trauma-rooted emotional shifts vs neurochemical cycling.
* Anxiety & substance use: Common companions; self-medicating worsens symptoms.
* Cultural bias: Women of color underdiagnosed; creatives misread.
* Cyclothymia/rapid cycling: Chronic, milder mood fluctuations; faster patterns of instability.

### Treatment & Healing

* Mood stabilizers: Lithium (gold standard), Lamotrigine (depression-focused), Valproate.
* Atypical antipsychotics: Quetiapine, Latuda, etc. for mood regulation.
* Antidepressants: Used cautiously; can trigger hypomania.
* Therapy: CBT (thoughts/behavior), DBT (emotion regulation), IFS (parts & shame).
* Lifestyle: Sleep hygiene, regular routines, exercise, light therapy.
* Peer support: Vital for understanding, solidarity, validation.
* Self-compassion: Distancing self from illness, reducing shame.
* Crisis planning: Early warning signs, emergency contacts, voluntary hospitalization plans.

### Reframes & Recovery

* "You are not your mood — you are the one riding the waves."
* Hypomania isn’t always fun; depression isn’t always visible.
* Bipolar II is not lesser; it’s serious and often missed.
* Diagnosis = a door, not a life sentence.
* Recovery = nonlinear but real; stability is possible and worth it.

Let it speak for the misdiagnosed, the mislabeled, and the ones still waiting to be seen. This vault gives name to their tides.
