**MiFam Dynamic Follow-Up Logic – Sample Path: Impulsivity**

---

### 🏋️ INITIAL SYMPTOM TRIGGER:

> User rates **"Impulsivity"** at 3.0 or higher

### ✅ Diagnosis Overlaps:

* **ADHD**
* **BPD**
* **Bipolar II**
* (Minor overlap: CPTSD)

---

### 🔀 BRANCH INITIATION:

> Echo says:
> "That kind of impulsivity shows up in a few different patterns — sometimes it’s energy-driven, sometimes emotion-driven. Can I ask a few quick questions to help us understand how yours shows up?"

---

### ❓ FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (User selects from simple responses)

#### **Q1: Does your impulsivity usually happen in moments of high emotion or conflict?**

* "Yes, especially when I’m upset or scared" → **+0.5 BPD, +0.25 C-PTSD**
* "Not really, it happens randomly" → **+0.5 ADHD**
* "Only when I’m feeling really great or energized" → **+0.5 Bipolar II**

---

#### **Q2: How do you feel afterward?**

* "Ashamed or regretful" → **+0.5 BPD, +0.25 Depression**
* "Fine — just on to the next thing" → **+0.5 ADHD**
* "A bit embarrassed, but I rationalize it" → **+0.25 OCD, +0.25 GAD**

---

#### **Q3: Do you notice any patterns in when this happens?**

* "Before my period or during mood swings" → **+0.5 PMDD, +0.25 Bipolar II**
* "When I'm bored or under-stimulated" → **+0.5 ADHD**
* "During social stress or relationship tension" → **+0.5 BPD, +0.25 C-PTSD**

### 🔄 FOLLOW-UP SCORE INTEGRATION:

Each answer adds weight to diagnosis scores. These scores get rolled into the main tally and re-evaluated for branching.

Echo then continues:

> "Thanks for sharing that — it gives a much clearer picture. Based on your answers, this impulsivity leans more toward \[highest-scoring match]. Would you like to explore how that plays out in real-life experiences or coping strategies?"

### 🧳 FUTURE DYNAMIC PATHS (Coming Next):

* **Overthinking / Rumination**: GAD vs OCD vs CPTSD vs Depression
* **Shame / Worthlessness**: Depression vs CPTSD vs Autism
* **Relationship Chaos**: BPD vs CPTSD vs PMDD
* **Meltdowns / Rage**: Autism vs PMDD vs BPD vs Bipolar

These follow-ups allow Echo to clarify overlapping patterns without overwhelm, increasing accuracy and emotional safety.
