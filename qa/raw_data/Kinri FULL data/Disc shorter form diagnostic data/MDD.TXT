## Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) – Diagnostic Vault Entry

### Core Diagnostic Criteria

* DSM-5: Depressed mood or anhedonia for at least 2 weeks, plus other symptoms causing distress or impairment.
* ICD-10: Classifies by episode (mild, moderate, severe); similar core features.
* ICD-11: Flexible with episode duration; includes mixed depression-anxiety.
* Key Features: Intensity, duration, and life impairment distinguish MDD from sadness.
* Cultural/Gender: Masked depression (e.g., anger, somatic complaints), male irritability, female tearfulness, somatic expressions in non-Western cultures.

### Symptom Clusters

**Emotional:**

* Persistent low mood, emptiness, numbness
* Tearfulness or inability to cry
* Irritability or emotional flatness

**Cognitive:**

* Hopelessness, self-blame, guilt
* Indecision, poor concentration
* Suicidal ideation (passive or active)

**Physical:**

* Fatigue, low energy
* Appetite/sleep disturbances (increased or decreased)
* Psychomotor slowing or agitation
* Aches, pains, digestive issues

**Behavioral:**

* Withdrawal, isolation
* Shutdown, anhedonia
* Neglecting responsibilities or self-care
* Risk-taking or self-sabotage

### Real-World Experience

* High-functioning depression: appearing fine while suffering silently
* Relational strain: withdrawal, irritability, parenting struggles
* Existential collapse: loss of meaning, identity, purpose
* Children/teens: irritability, acting out, somatic complaints, mislabelled as defiant
* Elderly: memory loss, fatigue, misattributed to aging

### Trauma Links & Origins

* Childhood adversity: neglect, invalidation, unresolved grief
* Intergenerational trauma and attachment wounds
* Neurodivergence and temperament sensitivity
* Chronic stress and identity loss (e.g., career change, caregiving, parenthood)

### Neurology & Physiology

**Neurotransmitters:**

* Serotonin: mood regulation
* Dopamine: reward, motivation
* Norepinephrine: alertness, drive

**Brain Areas:**

* PFC: low activity (reduced executive function)
* Amygdala: overactive (negative bias)
* Hippocampus: shrinkage (memory/emotion regulation)

**HPA Axis:**

* Dysregulation (cortisol overload or underactivation)

**Inflammation:**

* Elevated cytokines in some depressed individuals
* Linked to immune dysfunction and chronic malaise

### Comorbidities & Differential Diagnosis

* With: Anxiety, ADHD, Bipolar II, CPTSD, grief, PMDD
* Melancholic vs Atypical depression
* Masking in ND and gender-diverse individuals
* Self-harm vs suicidality
* Situational vs chronic (e.g., PDD/dysthymia)
* Grief vs depression distinctions
* Bipolar II misdiagnosis risk

### Treatment & Healing

**Therapies:**

* CBT: thought restructuring, behavioral activation
* Psychodynamic: uncovering unconscious patterns
* Trauma-informed: EMDR, IFS, somatic work
* Interpersonal therapy: relational focus

**Medications:**

* SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical antidepressants (e.g., bupropion, mirtazapine)
* Ketamine/esketamine for treatment-resistant cases
* Supplements (Omega-3, D, B-vits), with guidance

**Lifestyle:**

* Movement/exercise
* Nature and sunlight exposure
* Sleep hygiene and routines
* Nutrition and hydration

**Nervous System Regulation:**

* Breathwork, grounding, somatic tools
* Mindfulness, body-based healing (e.g., yoga)
* Creative expression (art, writing)

**Connection & Meaning:**

* Support groups, honest conversations
* Repairing or redefining relationships
* Rediscovering purpose through small roles or service

### Reframes & Recovery

* "You are not broken – your system is responding to pain"
* Depression as survival shutdown, not weakness
* Grief, rage, and numbness as healing portals
* Recovery is non-linear, layered, deeply personal
* Growth can follow pain; life can reawaken
