    "question": "What is dysbiosis?",
    "answer": "Dysbiosis is an imbalance in the gut microbiome, where harmful microbes outnumber or suppress beneficial ones.",

  {
    "question": "How does dysbiosis drive inflammation?",
    "answer": "Harmful bacteria can damage the gut lining and release endotoxins (like LPS), triggering immune responses and systemic inflammation.",

      "inflammation",
      "endotoxins",
      "LPS"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What is LPS and why is it harmful?",
    "answer": "LPS (lipopolysaccharide) is a toxin from gram-negative bacteria that, when leaked into the bloodstream, activates the immune system and promotes chronic inflammation.",

    "question": "Can dysbiosis affect mental health?",
    "answer": "Yes. Dysbiosis has been linked to depression, anxiety, and cognitive changes via the gut-brain axis and inflammatory pathways.",

  {
    "question": "How can diet help correct dysbiosis?",
    "answer": "A fiber-rich, whole-food diet with fermented foods and minimal ultra-processed ingredients can support microbial balance.",

    "question": "What role do probiotics play in correcting dysbiosis?",
    "answer": "Probiotics can help reintroduce beneficial strains, crowd out pathogens, and restore microbial diversity.",

  {
    "question": "How does stress impact dysbiosis and inflammation?",
    "answer": "Chronic stress alters gut motility, reduces protective bacteria, and increases inflammatory cytokines \u2014 all of which worsen dysbiosis.",

      "stress",
      "cytokines",
      "gut function"

  {
    "question": "Is inflammation from dysbiosis reversible?",
    "answer": "Yes. With dietary changes, lifestyle support, and sometimes supplementation, the gut can often rebalance and reduce inflammation.",
