**MiFam Compare View Logic – Echo Diagnostic Differentiation Helper**

This module helps Echo guide users who are stuck between 2–3 top-matching diagnostic patterns.
Echo offers gentle, side-by-side comparisons in plain language, then invites the user to reflect or explore.

### 🧐 COMPARE VIEW: BPD vs C-PTSD

**Echo says:**

> "Both of these patterns — Borderline Personality Disorder and Complex PTSD — can involve emotional overwhelm, shame, and relationship struggles. But they usually come from different places, and feel different inside."

| Trait                     | BPD                                    | C-PTSD                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Emotional Triggers        | Sudden, reactive shifts                | Long-term buildup, delayed reactions        |
| Core Fear                 | Abandonment                            | Betrayal, loss of safety                    |
| Relationship Dynamics     | Push-pull, idealization vs devaluation | Withdrawal, mistrust, people-pleasing       |
| Self-Perception           | Unstable identity, emptiness           | Chronic shame, "brokenness"                 |
| Flashbacks / Dissociation | In-the-moment emotional overwhelm      | Full sensory flashbacks, depersonalization  |
| Cause/Origin              | Often relational trauma + sensitivity  | Prolonged abuse, neglect, captivity         |
| Recovery Focus            | Emotion regulation + self-concept work | Trauma processing + rebuilding trust/safety |

**Echo follows with:**

> "Does one of those descriptions feel closer to your experience? Or do you see pieces of both? Either way, I’m here to walk with you through it."

### 📊 COMPARE VIEW: ADHD vs Autism

**Echo says:**

> "These two neurotypes can overlap — especially with focus issues and sensory stuff — but they tend to feel different from the inside."

| Trait              | ADHD                                       | Autism                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Attention Pattern  | Distractible, novelty-seeking              | Hyperfocused on interests, easily overstimulated |
| Social Challenges  | Interrupts, blurts, impulsive              | Misses cues, needs clarity, social exhaustion    |
| Emotional Style    | Impatient, explosive, intense but moves on | Shutdowns, internal meltdowns, masking           |
| Sensory Experience | Seeks stimulation, fidgety                 | Sensitive to noise, texture, light               |
| Executive Function | Disorganized, forgetful                    | Rigid planning or total avoidance                |
| Masking            | Rare, unless socially conditioned          | Common — can cause exhaustion and burnout        |
| Coping Needs       | Movement, stimulation, short bursts        | Structure, predictability, decompression         |

**Echo follows with:**

> "Want to look deeper into either ADHD or Autism with me? Or see how they might co-exist?"

### 🔀 COMPARE VIEW LOGIC TRIGGERS

* Activated if two (or more) diagnoses score ≥ 4.0
* Echo selects highest pair and renders side-by-side table
* User chooses: "Explore A," "Explore B," "Both," or "Still not sure"

If user selects "Still not sure," Echo offers:

> "That’s okay. We can keep exploring gently — no pressure to pick a path today."

### 📌 FUTURE COMPARE SETS TO BUILD

* PMDD vs BPD
* OCD vs Autism
* Bipolar II vs BPD
* GAD vs OCD
* Depression vs CPTSD
* Autism vs Schizoid PD (social withdrawal vs detachment)

These compare views let users feel clarity without pressure, and reduce self-diagnosis anxiety by highlighting lived experience over checklists.
